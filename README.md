# Positional Value
This is some baseline analysis I did, using regression tools and exploratory data analysis skills. It's still a work in progress, as everything is,
but NFL data is extremely interesting to me and I hope to continue to build from here.

Data comes from NFLfastR, and pulled some other elements from Lee Sharpe's work in the space.
